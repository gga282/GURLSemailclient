# GURLS Email Client

GURLS Email Client is a command-line email client built with Python. It lets you send and receive emails, handle attachments, search your inbox, and even download emails for offline reading. This project is one of my first major efforts as a self-taught developer, and I'm excited to share my progress and continue learning along the way!
